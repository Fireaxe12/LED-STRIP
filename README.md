# LED-STRIP
My goal is to light up an entire house with strings of individually addressable LEDs.
I've been collecting one reel a week and have 342ft so far. They're 300 LED rolls, so 
I'm going to need a lot of drivers and power supplies. The trick is to coordinate the lights
using wifi.
I'm playing with an Arduino Yun Rev 2, Integreight 1Sheeld+, BTF-LIGHTING K-1000C,
DFRobot RGB LED Strip Driver Shield, and a Integreight 1Sheeld+
BTF-LIGHTING K-1000C and a DFRobot RGB LED Strip Driver Shield.
I'll end up using several BTF units as I intend to run a lot more than 2,000 Leds.
